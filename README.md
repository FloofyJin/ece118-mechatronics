# ECE 118 - Lucky Charm



## Structure

This repo was made specifically to organize and keep track of the development process of the robot that was built for the class ECE118 - Introduction to mechatronics. This course had me and two other students design a bot from scratch that would pick up balls from one side of the field and drop it on the other side. Depiction of the field is shown in the file "FieldRendered.JPG". Part of the challenge involves us designing the base using a modeling software as autobox or solidworks and puting together Uno32 and an array of other hardware components to sense the edge of the field and route to the trap door which would be emitting frequency through a track wire.
